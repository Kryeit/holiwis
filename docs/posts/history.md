Telepost was started while Season 1 was ongoing, the idea came from a plugin called Population density.

- `Starting 2021` Season 1 started without Telepost, and was developed as it went on
- `May 3, 2021` - first version of Telepost was launched on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/telepost.91988/history)
- `May 22, 2021` - A Kryeit player named BlockOG contributed code to Telepost, specially regarding post logic
- `Dec 23, 202` - Season 2 started without Telepost, when the port was done it was added months later
- `Jun 20, 2023` - [This commit](https://github.com/muriplz/Telepost/commit/020e8a90629f2fd5b916a42172de771fc4e138be) made by MrRedRhino, his first contribution to Kryeit aside Pipeman starters, introduced the data storage we use to this day, which improved the plugin a lot
- `Sep 7, 2023` - __Tesseract, Enzoquest10, OlimilO1402 and Do_you_know_wae started building [133](https://github.com/Kryeit/Telepost/tree/1.20.1/src/main/resources/structures) posts, one per vanilla biome and Terralith biome, 31x31 of size each. This task took around 3 months
- `Oct 4, 2023` - __Tesseract and me, MuriPlz, started to find a good way to add the Terrain adaptation of the post building logic, which relies in World Edit Api
