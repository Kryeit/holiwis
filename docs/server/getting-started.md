This is a Java Minecraft server focused in the [Create mod](https://createmod.net). We aim for a long term mindset and a technical minecraft focus, although we welcome any playstyle.

### How to join
[This modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/kryeit) is mandatory to join the server. Although you may use any of the [Kryeit modpacks](https://kryeit.com/modpacks).

The server IP is `kryeit.com`. The server doesn't have any Whitelist, anyone can join!

We have some systems in place that you probably want to learn about if you're sticking here:

### Posts

This is our nerfed teleportation system! And how does it work?:

The whole overworld is used as a grid for these structures called "Posts". In the current season the posts are 5.000 blocks apart from one another, forming a squared grid all across the overworld.

The main distinction is that you can only use teleport commands while being close to a post.

### Claiming

You can claim land easily, which makes your base not accessibly by other players.
