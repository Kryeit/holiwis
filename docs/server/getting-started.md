If you are new, welcome!

Kryeit survival is fairly simple, you can just join and play it out as if it was vanilla.

We have some systems in place that you probably want to learn about if you're sticking here.

### Posts

This is our nerfed teleportation system! And how does it work?:

The whole overworld is used as a grid for these structures called "Posts". In the current season the posts are 5.000 blocks apart from one another, forming a squared grid all across the overworld.

The main distinction is that you can only use teleport commands while being close to a post.

### Claiming

You can claim land easily, which makes your base not accessibly by other players.
